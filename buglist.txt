Bug #1:
Description: undo impossible with current data structure because of direct reference to nodes
Closer-look: this.nodes is currently linked with this.history, so changing an element in
this.history will change this.nodes too. However, if they are not linked, weird stuff happens
when redoing to the first step.
Solution: Potential compromise can be creating a separate text array to store stuff
this will be used when reverting histories
Solution(continued): on store to history,

Bug #2:
Reproduce: add node, enter initla text, blur, enter more text, undo, add node, undo, redo
Try solving by: changing instead of pushing txtHistory

Bug #3:
Description: add new node
Desired effect: want 1) if new node created and blurred without input, store to history   (1 step)
                     2) if new node created and blurred with input, store that to history (1 step)

Solution: 1) Perhaps, play with store to history on addnewnode instead of blur first
          2) condition in blur should be (if texts is different or node is new){...}
             - to test if node is new, dblclick is not correct
             - perhaps, set a variable on addNewNode to true, and if we keydown, that variable is false
             - in blur, test if that variable is still true, if so, then we are in a new node at the end of blur, set that to false
